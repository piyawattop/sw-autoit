# Summoner's War Exporter

This tool will parse intercepted data from Summoner's War and extract information on the monsters and runes of the user. It works just like SWProxy and the focus was to write a smooth proxy, that runs fast and to fix common glitches with SWPRoxy (SW starting problems, errors on event pages etc.). You can even turn on Summoners War Exporter for normal surfing, because it doesnt really influence other pages much.
